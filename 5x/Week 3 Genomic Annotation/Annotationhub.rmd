### Hub exploration via query()

Use the commands

```{r}
library(AnnotationHub)
ah = AnnotationHub() # AnnotationHub with 36170 records
mah = mcols(ah) # DataFrame with 36170 rows and 10 columns
names(mah) # "species is one of the names"
sort(table(mah$species), decreasing=TRUE)[1:10]
```
We can see the number of entries devoted to H. sapiens and other species. Queries about the content of the hub can be nested. Use

```{r}
names(query(query(ah, "HepG2"), "CTCF"))
```
to find names of files that address binding of CTCF (a transcription factor involved in chromatin structure regulation) to DNA from HepG2 cells.

How many entries address CTCF binding in HepG2?:
