Obtain the hg19 to hg38 liftover chain file and decompress:

```{r, message=FALSE}
download.file("http://hgdownload.cse.ucsc.edu/goldenPath/hg19/liftOver/hg19ToHg38.over.chain.gz",
  "hg19ToHg38.over.chain.gz")
library(R.utils)
gunzip("hg19ToHg38.over.chain.gz")
```

We will use it to convert the HepG2 binding addresses to hg38.

```{r,message=FALSE}
library(ERBS)
data(HepG2)
library(rtracklayer)
ch = import.chain("hg19ToHg38.over.chain") 
nHepG2 = liftOver(HepG2, ch)
```

How far, in bases, has the first range in HepG2 (chr2, 20335378 is starting address) moved upstream in the hg38 build?:

```{r}
start(HepG2[1])-start(nHepG2[1])
```
